                     INITIAL PRICE TIER VALIDATION FINDINGS
                              February 3, 2026
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
We analyzed 2,264 quotes from Sabel Steel and coosasteel.com (Aug 25, 2025 -
Feb 3, 2026) to validate whether price tier assignments make sense based on
order characteristics.

KEY FINDING: Tier assignments appear to be driven by factors BEYOND order
characteristics (likely relationship/strategic factors). The model could only
explain 65% of assignments using order data alone.


================================================================================
                              METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

WHAT WE DID (Plain English)
---------------------------
1. We looked at each quote's ORDER CHARACTERISTICS:
   - How big is the estimate? (ESTIMATETOTALPRICE)
   - How many units? (ESTIMATETOTALQUANTITY, QTYPERLINEITEM)
   - What's the unit price? (LINEITEMUNITPRICE)
   - How heavy is the material? (MATERIALUNITWEIGHT)
   - What's the cost per hundredweight? (MATERIALCENTWEIGHTCOST)

2. We asked: "Can we predict which Price Tier a quote belongs to just by
   looking at these order characteristics?"

3. We trained a Random Forest classifier (a machine learning model that
   learns patterns from data) using cross-validation (the model is tested
   on data it hasn't seen during training).

4. For each purchaser, we compared:
   - What tier are they ACTUALLY assigned to?
   - What tier does the MODEL think they should be in?
   - Do they match?


WHY THIS MATTERS
----------------
If two purchasers have similar order patterns (size, price, quantity) but are
in DIFFERENT tiers, one of two things is true:

   A) The tier difference is INTENTIONAL (relationship factors, strategic
      accounts, negotiation history - stuff not in the data)

   B) The tier assignment might be WRONG and should be reviewed


THE MODEL: Random Forest Classifier
------------------------------------

WHAT IS A DECISION TREE?
   Imagine playing "20 Questions" to guess a tier:

   Q1: "Is the estimate over $1,000?"
       YES → Q2: "Is the unit weight over 200 lbs?"
             YES → Predict Tier_3
             NO  → Predict Tier_1
       NO  → Q3: "Is the margin over 20%?"
             YES → Predict Tier_2
             NO  → Predict Tier_4

   A decision tree learns WHICH questions to ask and WHERE to draw the
   lines (why $1,000? why 200 lbs?) by looking at the training data.

WHAT IS A RANDOM FOREST?
   One tree can be "overconfident" - it memorizes quirks in the data.

   A Random Forest creates 100 DIFFERENT trees, each trained on a
   slightly different random sample of the data. Each tree learns
   different patterns.

   To make a prediction:
   1. Show the quote to all 100 trees
   2. Each tree votes: "I think this is Tier_X"
   3. Final answer = whichever tier gets the most votes

   This "wisdom of crowds" approach is more reliable than any single tree.

   Example:
      Tree 1 says: Tier_1
      Tree 2 says: Tier_3
      Tree 3 says: Tier_1
      ...
      Tree 100 says: Tier_1

      If 73 trees say Tier_1 and 27 say Tier_3 → Predict Tier_1


WHAT IS CROSS-VALIDATION?
   Problem: If we train and test on the SAME data, the model just
   memorizes the answers. That's cheating - it doesn't tell us how
   well the model works on NEW data.

   Solution: 5-Fold Cross-Validation

   We split the 2,024 quotes into 5 equal groups (folds):

   Round 1: Train on folds 2,3,4,5 → Test on fold 1 (predict 405 quotes)
   Round 2: Train on folds 1,3,4,5 → Test on fold 2 (predict 405 quotes)
   Round 3: Train on folds 1,2,4,5 → Test on fold 3 (predict 405 quotes)
   Round 4: Train on folds 1,2,3,5 → Test on fold 4 (predict 405 quotes)
   Round 5: Train on folds 1,2,3,4 → Test on fold 5 (predict 404 quotes)

   Every quote gets a prediction from a model that NEVER saw that quote
   during training. This gives us an honest measure of accuracy.

   Our 65% accuracy means: when we show the model a quote it's never
   seen before, it correctly guesses the tier 65% of the time.


FEATURES USED (what the model sees)
-----------------------------------
   - ESTIMATETOTALPRICE (total quote value)
   - ESTIMATETOTALQUANTITY (total units)
   - QTYPERLINEITEM (units per line)
   - LINEITEMUNITPRICE (price per unit)
   - MATERIALUNITWEIGHT (weight per unit)
   - MATERIALCENTWEIGHTCOST (cost per hundredweight)

WHAT THE MODEL DOES NOT SEE
---------------------------
   - Purchaser name/identity
   - Historical relationship
   - Geographic factors
   - Negotiation context
   - Sales rep decisions

   This is intentional. We WANT to know: "Based ONLY on order
   characteristics, what tier should this quote be in?"

   If the model predicts a different tier than assigned, it means the
   order characteristics don't explain the assignment - something else
   (relationship, strategy, etc.) must be driving it.


================================================================================
                              KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. OVERALL MODEL ACCURACY: 65%
------------------------------
The model correctly predicts the assigned tier 65% of the time. This means
35% of the time, the order characteristics suggest a DIFFERENT tier than
what was assigned.

Interpretation: Tier assignments are partially based on order characteristics,
but other factors (relationships, strategy) play a big role.


2. TIER-BY-TIER ACCURACY
------------------------
Tier_1:  79% correctly classified (725 quotes)
Tier_2:  83% correctly classified (637 quotes)
Tier_3:  47% correctly classified (409 quotes)
Tier_4:  12% correctly classified (140 quotes) ← Model struggles here
Tier_5:   3% correctly classified (113 quotes) ← Model struggles here

Tier_4 and Tier_5 look almost identical to Tier_1 based on order data.
This suggests these tiers are differentiated by NON-ORDER factors.


3. PURCHASERS IN POTENTIAL WRONG TIER
-------------------------------------
These purchasers have order patterns that don't match their assigned tier:

PURCHASER               | ASSIGNED | WIN RATE | MODEL SAYS | CONCERN
------------------------|----------|----------|------------|--------
wescoweld.com           | Tier_4   | 8%       | Tier_1     | Low wins
thomasmachineandfab.com | Tier_3   | 15%      | Tier_1     | Low wins
davismachineworks.com   | Tier_3   | 0%       | Tier_1     | NEVER wins
TYSONMETALWORKS.COM     | Tier_3   | 0%       | Tier_1     | NEVER wins
cahabatruck.com         | Tier_5   | 100%     | Tier_1     | Always wins!

The 0% win rate purchasers are concerning - they may be over-priced.
The 100% win rate purchaser may be getting too good a deal.


4. TIER_1 PARADOX
-----------------
Tier_1 contains two purchasers with opposite outcomes:

   contractors-steel.com:  360 quotes, 87% win rate, avg $3,984
   marburysteel.com:       365 quotes,  0% win rate, avg $805

Same tier, completely different results. One almost always wins, one never wins.
This suggests Tier_1 may need to be split, or one is misassigned.
Actually - one may use this just for quoting ***


================================================================================
                           RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. REVIEW 0% WIN RATE PURCHASERS
   - davismachineworks.com (Tier_3, 0% win rate)
   - TYSONMETALWORKS.COM (Tier_3, 0% win rate)
   - marburysteel.com (Tier_1, 0% win rate)

   If these customers consistently lose quotes, their pricing may be too high.
   Consider moving to a lower-margin tier to win more business.

2. INVESTIGATE TIER_1 SPLIT
   The huge difference between contractors-steel.com (87% wins) and
   marburysteel.com (0% wins) suggests Tier_1 may be too broad.

3. VALIDATE HIGH-WIN-RATE ACCOUNTS
   - cahabatruck.com (Tier_5, 100% win rate) - Are we leaving money on table?
   - contractors-steel.com (Tier_1, 87% win rate) - Same question

4. CONSIDER ADDITIONAL DATA
   The model only explains 65% of assignments. To improve predictions,
   consider adding:
   - Customer tenure/history
   - Geographic region
   - Industry segment
   - Competitive landscape indicators


================================================================================
                           LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

1. The model can only see ORDER characteristics, not relationship factors.
   A "misclassified" purchaser might be correctly assigned based on factors
   we can't measure.

2. Win rate can be affected by many factors beyond pricing (lead time,
   service quality, competition in that customer's market).

3. Small sample sizes for some purchasers may not be representative.

4. The model assumes tier assignment SHOULD be based on order characteristics.
   If the business intentionally uses other criteria, the model's
   recommendations may not apply.


================================================================================
                              NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Share findings with pricing team for business context
2. Deep dive on 0% win rate accounts - why are they never winning?
3. Analyze if high-margin tiers are systematically losing more quotes
4. Consider adding customer relationship data to improve predictions


================================================================================
